# Covid-19 Information App for iOS (iOS 13 and above)

## Development Tool:
  * At first, I used SwiftUI framework on Xcode 11.4(11E146). For now, I use Xcode 11.6(11E708). <br>

## Maintain Daily:
  * This is one of my practice projects, not serious one. Apparently, this isn't a perfect version. I probably will keep updating and revising it during my leisure time.<br>
  * 2020/04/14 made by Albert Cheng from Taiwan[TW] (github: @Lucky19921), revising and upload on 2020/04/15.<br>
  * 2020/04/23 API address is invalid, I will fix it recently.<br>
  * 2020/04/24 I'm trying to fix the problem about searching some special country that made app crushing.<br>
  * 2020/08/07 Fix the issue about error of fetching data at specific country. Some countries name have blank. There it results in fetching error. For example, S. Korea, Hong Kong and Burkina Faso... etc,.<br>
  * ~But it seems like string issue???? Working on it and need more time.~ Fix and Done!<br>
  * 2020/08/31 Sperate some class and function. That will not influence App.<br>
  * 2021/03/19 This app still works but I'm too busy to maintain this app anymore.<br>
