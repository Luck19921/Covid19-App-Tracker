# Covid-19 Information App for iOS (iOS 13 and above)

## Development Tool:
  * At first, I used SwiftUI framework on Xcode 11.4(11E146). For now, I use Xcode 11.6(11E708). <br>

## Maintain Daily:
  * This is one of my practice projects, not serious one. Apparently, this isn't a perfect version. I probably will keep updating and revising it during my leisure time.<br>
  * 2020/04/14 made by Albert Cheng from Taiwan[TW] (github: @Lucky19921), revising and upload on 2020/04/15.<br>
  * 2020/04/23 API address is invalid, I will fix it recently.<br>
  * 2020/04/24 I'm trying to fix the problem about searching some special country that made app crushing.<br>
    * ~But it seems like string issue???? Working on it and need more time.~ DONE!<br>
