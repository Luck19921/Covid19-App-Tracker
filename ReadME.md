# Covid-19 Information App for iOS (iOS version: above iOS 13)

## This is one of my practice projects, not serious one. Apparently, this isn't a perfect version. I probably will keep updating and revising it during my leisure time.
## Use Xcode Version 11.4(11E146) SwiftUI framework.
## All of the references and learning materials https://kavsoft.tech/
## 2020/04/14 made by Albert Cheng from Taiwan[TW] (github: @Lucky19921), revising and upload on 2020/04/15.
### 2020/04/23 API address is invalid, I will fix it recently. ###

# 2020/04/24 I'm trying to fix the problem about searching some special country that made app crushing.
~But it seems like string issue???? Working on it and need more time.~ DONE!
