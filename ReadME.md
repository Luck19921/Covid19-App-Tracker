# Covid-19 Information App for iOS (iOS version: above iOS 13)



## Maintain Daily:
This is one of my practice projects, not serious one. Apparently, this isn't a perfect version. I probably will keep updating and revising it during my leisure time.<br>
Xcode Version 11.4(11E146) SwiftUI framework.<br>
2020/04/14 made by Albert Cheng from Taiwan[TW] (github: @Lucky19921), revising and upload on 2020/04/15.<br>
2020/04/23 API address is invalid, I will fix it recently.<br>
2020/04/24 I'm trying to fix the problem about searching some special country that made app crushing.<br>
~But it seems like string issue???? Working on it and need more time.~ DONE!<br>
